Cinder-VJ_Boilerplate
=====================

A Music Visualization Boilerplate using the Cinder Library

## SETUP

Most of the files required to get going are already included. The only thing you need to do, is linking this project to your Cinder-Library. For doing so, go to your Project > Build Settings > User-Defined and then change "CINDER_PATH", so they match your Cinder directory.
